This repository provides microscopy image analysis to reproduce the reported data in our paper. 

## Microscopy Data
Our microscopy data is available at:

## Jupyter Notebook
Four notebooks are uploaded. The Notebooks are designed to analyze cell growth under constant or oscillating oxygen environments. 

### GrowthRate_constant/oscillation_oxygen
These notebooks are used to analyze an image stack. They are designed to perform microbial growth analysis under constant/oscillating oxygen environments. Cells are segmented and individual cell information is extracted. 

### ScalingAnalysis_constant/oscillation_oxygen
These notebooks are used to apply the GrowthRate analysis script to a large number of image stacks. It also allows to combine the results from multiple image stacks in the same dataset or project.
